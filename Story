    Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey, who resided on a Jamun tree,
which was on the banks of the river. In the forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
The monkey wanted to make a cloth for himself using crocodile skin. He started trying to befriend
the crocodile by feeding him the berries. The berries were delicious and the crocodile liked them.
After some time, the monkey started poisoning the berries.
